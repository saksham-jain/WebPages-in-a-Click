# WebPages-in-a-Click
Feeling tired and want to open all Work related webpages?Here is the solution.

Get all your webpages open in your default Browser in just a double-click on python script icon using very simple python script.

I have created two python script one(work.py) for work related webpages and other one(social.py) is for all the social sites I like to use.

You can edit your favourite sites by just opening python script in python IDLE and change the urls.

Indeed this works fine to me.
